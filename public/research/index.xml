      <description>Abstract Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) suggests that worked examples, mathematical problems with written out solutions, can increase studentsâ€™ available working memory resources - which are a limited set of cognitive attention resources that allow students to learn mathematics concepts and solve word problems. At the same time, many students feel math anxiety when faced with math learning and problem solving, which can generate worries that engage the same limited set of working memory resources, reducing available resources for new learning and problem solving.</description>

      <description>Abstract Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is a type of blood cancer that originates within the bone marrow. This longitudinal study was held over a span of 14 weeks (112 days) with 24 MPN patients. The Total Symptom Score (TSS) ranges from 1-100, where a lower score relates to less symptoms or better health. In order to assess the symptoms that occur within MPN patients, a daily survey was administered over a span of 112 days assessing symptom burden.</description>

      <description>Introduction Adaptive therapy is a type of cancer treatment that undergoes period of chemo therapy followed by &amp;ldquo;drug holiday&amp;rdquo;, period of time when patients stop taking treatment. This type of treatment is effective in stabilizing the growth rate of tumor cell. We are using population growth ODE models for both susceptible/sensitive tumor cells and resistant tumor cells, with different therapy conditions. To test our conditions, we created a simulation for the ODE model, which allowed us to see changes in cell growth between different factors.</description>
