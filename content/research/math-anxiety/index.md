## Abstract

Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) suggests that worked examples, mathematical problems with written out solutions, can increase studentsâ€™ available working memory resources - which are a limited set of cognitive attention resources that allow students to learn mathematics concepts and solve word problems. At the same time, many students feel math anxiety when faced with math learning and problem solving, which can generate worries that engage the same limited set of working memory resources, reducing available resources for new learning and problem solving. Furthermore, gender gaps in math achievement continue to be a persistent issue, potentially being caused by the aggravated impact of math anxiety on girls. To test whether worked examples are able to equally reduce math anxiety on math performance for all students, a pre-post design experiment was conducted on 280 fifth-graders from ten schools in Orange County and Chicago to see whether worked examples could reduce mathematical anxiety in students learning ratios. A multiple linear regression model and path analysis models were used to assess the gender differences in the effects of worked examples. Findings indicate that for those who were given worked examples during instruction, regardless of their genders, their mathematical anxiety was mitigated which allowed them to perform more accurately in the delayed assessment. However, gender differences in the impact of math anxiety on problem-solving skills were still significant.
