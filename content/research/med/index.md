title: Impact of Mediterranean and DASH Diets on MPN Symptoms

### Abstract

Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is a type of blood cancer that originates within the bone marrow. This longitudinal study was held over a span of 14 weeks (112 days) with 24 MPN patients. The Total Symptom Score (TSS) ranges from 1-100, where a lower score relates to less symptoms or better health. In order to assess the symptoms that occur within MPN patients, a daily survey was administered over a span of 112 days assessing symptom burden. Our pri- mary scientific goal is to determine which diet had a higher impact on symptom burden. The two diets observed were the Mediterranean Diet which focused on the inclusion of healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts, and Dash Diet which served more on decreasing salt intake. Linear mixed modeling was utilized to analyze the scores and compare the effect of the diets. In the cohort study, we found multiple outliers, or abnormal observations, thus the modeling was done with the outliers and without for comparison reasons. Through observing both models, we have found that over time, both diets have a significant effect on improving the health of MPN patients. In addition, the longer the patients spent following the diets, the lower their symptom score is (p < 0.01). However, when excluding the outliers from the DASH group, we could not acquire enough evidence to conclude that the Mediterranean diet was more effective than DASH (p < 0.05). Lastly, there is no interaction between the day number and the diet type. This means that whichever diet was followed by the patients, time had an independent effect. Furthermore, during the 2 week baseline period where no intervention was made, the scores of MPN-TSS decreased for both groups. This alludes to the trend of the scores consistently decreasing throughout the study. Although both diets are impactful in reducing the symptoms associated with MPN, there is not enough evidence to warrant which diet is more impactful.
